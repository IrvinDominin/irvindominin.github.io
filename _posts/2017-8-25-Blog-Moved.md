title: Blog moved to GitHub pages!
---

My personal blog was originally on Wordpress, but, because it's on Wordpress (and I can't fall in love with Wordpress, and probably anyone can!), I decided to move it on Github pages.

It's a powerful platform, markdown editing, simple configuration and fully file-based using Jekyll.

So welcome!
