Kubernetes (aka K8s) is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers.

With Kubernetes is possible:
 - Deploy your applications quickly and predictably.
 - Scale your applications on the fly.
 - Roll out new features seamlessly.
 - Limit hardware usage to required resources only.

Kubernetes can be used in a public, private, hybrid, multi-cloud environment and offers all the features needed for extensibility, is modular and pluggable.
It can be setup for being reactive with all the DevOps loved features like auto-restart, auto-replication and auto-scaling.

Google started the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes demonstrates the experience that Google has with running production workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

<h2>Containers?</h2>
Kubernetes does its best on a container environment, for a brief contains story see <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-8-30-What-is-Docker %}">What is Docker</a>.

<h2>Why do I need Kubernetes and what can it do?</h2>
At a minimum, Kubernetes can schedule and run application containers on clusters of physical or virtual machines. Kubernetes also allows developers to ‘cut the cord’ to physical and virtual machines, moving from a host-centric infrastructure to a container-centric infrastructure, which provides the full advantages of containers.

This provides the simplicity of Platform as a Service (PaaS) with the flexibility of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and simplify portability across infrastructure providers.

<h2>Getting started</h2>
As usual on big projects like this, Kubernets provides a good and deep <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/">docs portal</a>, and is open source with a support coming from the community.
